Welcome! I am a PhD student specializing in how foundation models adapt under distribution shift, addressing challenges in continual learning, and few-shot learning. My advisor is [Siddhartha Bhattacharyya](https://www.fit.edu/faculty-profiles/b/bhattacharyya-siddhartha/), and I am funded by NASA, where I am working on lane detection for autonomous driving and taxiing on airports. 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani Dubai, where I finished my thesis under the guidance of [Raja Muthalaghu](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/dubai/raja-muthalagu/) and received the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award. Alongside my PhD, I have worked closely with mentors from Microsoft Research, NASA Langley, UTHealth Houston, Collins Aerospace. Through these collaborations, I have gained extensive experience especially in self-supervised models, text-to-image models, and multimodal large-language models.

*Reach out by email if our interests align and you wish to collaborate!*

**Also, I’m actively seeking an internship for Summer 2026—because models aren’t the only ones that need fine-tuning!!**
